			<h1>Understanding the concept of priority in CSS</h1>

			<p>You may already know that there are some ways to give an element the same attributes but with different values. It actually happens a lot!<br>Let's take a close look at what are the results of most of the possible contradictions.</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/css/understanding-css-priority-example.html" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/css-3-1.png" alt="HTML featuring 15 paragraphs, 10 being within 2 different sections, and all elements having various ids and classes"></a>

			<p>The &lt;body&gt; has a class, five paragraphs with various ids and classes and two &lt;sections&gt; which also have various ids and classes which each contain five similar paragraphs.<br>So, there are 15 different paragraphs in this HTML document, all being subject to different rules in one way or the other.</p>

			<p>What rules? Well, all of them are defined in the 60 lines of CSS right below, have fun figuring out how the HTML document will look like!</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/css/understanding-css-priority-example.css" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/css-3-2.png" alt="60 lines of contradicting CSS"></a>

			<p>So let's take a look at the first paragraph featured in the HTML file. All paragraphs inherit from the &lt;body&gt; element which has the class "all", which gives a red color to text.<br>This paragraph has the "one-c" class and the "one-i" id.<br>If you look at what the "one-c" class is, you'll see that it has an attribute that is defined two different times with two different values!</p>

			<p>In the CSS file, this class gets "text-align: right" on Line 10 and "text-align: left" on Line 14.<br>Also, the paragraph gets "text-align: center" from the &lt;body&gt; element, written on Line 2.<br>The "one-i" id doesn't do anything to "text-align", but does give "color: blue" in Line 28 after it gave "color: green" in Line 22.<br>Also, the "one-c" class gives "color: pink" in Line 17. Fun!</p>

			<p>The first paragraph ends up being aligned to the left, with a blue color, among other things. How come?</p>

			<p>Basically, inheritance is lowest priority, then there's the class and finally, the id.<br>The first paragraph gets the color red from the &lt;body&gt; element, then the color pink from its class, then the color green from both its class and id and finally, the color blue from its id.</p>

			<p>The priority in CSS file is simple: If it's below, it has the priority. So the class ends up never having the pink color, and the id ends up never having the green color.<br>So for the first paragraph, it's a contest between the inheritance with the red color, the class with the green color and the id with the blue color.<br>The class has priority over the inheritance and the id has priority over the class. Blue > Green > Red.</p>

			<p>The second paragraph is exactly the same as the first one, despite the order in which it gets its class and id being different.<br>The third paragraph doesn't have the "one-i" id, so it ends up being green among other things!</p>

			<p>The fourth paragraph isn't similar to the first and second ones despite having the "one-i" id because it doesn't have the "one-c" class.<br>You see, while the first and second paragraphs treated "one-i" with priority, it still got, for example, the "text-align: left" from "one-c", while the fourth one ends up using the "text-align" it inherited from the &lt;body&gt; element, "text-align: center"!</p>

			<p>The fifth paragraph is simple, it only uses what it inherited from the &lt;body&gt; element, as it doesn't have a class, an id, or anything else to inherit from.</p>

			<p>Paragraphs 6 to 9 are the same as 1 to 4, with the difference that those have a &lt;section&gt; they can inherit from, with priority over the &lt;body&gt; element.<br>6 to 9 still have the id > class > inheritance order, of course, but the inheritance they get is more complex as they have a second element to inherit from, their &lt;section&gt;.<br>Their &lt;section&gt; has priority over the &lt;body&gt; element as it is "closer", not in terms of lines but rather in terms of.. parent-child relation? The paragraph will inherit mostly from its parent (&lt;section&gt;), then from its grand-parent (&lt;body&gt;), and so on if the &lt;body&gt;'s parent, the &lt;html&gt; element, had any attribute. Hopefully you get it.</p>

			<p>The tenth paragraph differs from the fifth one despite both not having any class or id as the tenth paragraph inherits from both the &lt;section&gt; element and the &lt;body&gt; element, while the fifth only inherits from the &lt;body&gt; element, and the &lt;section&gt; element has priority over the &lt;body&gt; element as we already discussed.</p>

			<p>And finally, paragraphs 11 to 15. All of them, just like paragraphs 6 to 10, inherit from their respective &lt;section&gt; (both share the same class) and then from the &lt;body&gt; element, but the difference here is that this &lt;section&gt; also has an id, which has priority over the class!<br>Therefore, if the &lt;section&gt;'s class and the &lt;section&gt;'s id have two contradicting attributes, the paragraphs will inherit from the &lt;section&gt;'s id rather than its class. That is what happens with the "font-size".<br>The id gives "font-size: 150px" while the class gives "font-size: 20px". The paragraphs end up with the id's "font-size".</p>

			<p>Pretty much the same thing happens with the fifteen paragraph's color, which doesn't end up red like the fifth or yellow like the tenth, but black.</p>

			<p>There are various attributes I did not mention, but by now, you should be able to understand what gets affected how by CSS' priority system!</p>
