			<h1>Having control over the size of your HTML elements with CSS</h1>

			<p>Right below is a mess of a webpage, featuring text and images of various sizes, in weird positions relative to elements visible thanks to an horrible choice of background colors.</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/css/having-control-over-size-example.html" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/css-2-1.png" alt="HTML crowded with URLs"></a>

			<p>It wouldn't be such a mess without the CSS file below, though. We will be focusing on the CSS as the HTML is pretty simple.<br>Just in case though, in the HTML, the id attribute is just like class, but the difference is that only one element will have a certain id.</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/css/having-control-over-size-example.css" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/css-2-2.png" alt="CSS for the above HTML"></a>

			<p>First of all, let's talk about Line 22 and Line 28, as they work slightly differently compared to the usual "HTML element before the brackets in which attributes and values are".</p>

			<p>So Line 22 has two elements which are separated by a space, which means that what's inside the brackets will affect all second elements that are inside any of all of the first elements.<br>In this example, what's inside the brackets affects all img elements that are inside any of the elements that has the "example-2" class. We know it's a class because of the dot before the name.</p>

			<p>Line 28 has four elements separated, with one comma and two spaces. We already know what separation with spaces does, but what about separation by commas?<br>It means that both the second element inside the first and the fourth element inside the third will be affected by whatever is inside the brackets that follow them!<br>So in this case, the img elements from elements that have either the "ghost" id or the "ghost-2" id will get affected by whatever's inside the brackets!<br>We know "ghost" and "ghost-2" are ids because there is a # before both names.</p>

			<p>Now, have you ever heard of the Box Model? It's something quite important, so remember the following!<br>You can think of every HTML element has a box composed of 4 things.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Content, the area where images and text appears</li>
				<li>Padding, the transparent area between the border and the content</li>
				<li>Border, the area between the padding and the margin</li>
				<li>Margin, the transparent area outside of the border</li>
			</ol>

			<p>I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_boxmodel" target="_blank">this link</a> if you got confused!</p>

			<p>Remember that HTML is basically elements within elements, themselves within elements. <a href="../html/initial-html-structure.html" target="_blank">The initial structure of any HTML file</a> features the &lt;body&gt; element, which has a slight margin which affects its position so it gets further away from the &lt;html&gt; element!<br>In the mess of a webpage I showed you quite a bit ago, if the &lt;body&gt;'s margin was of 0px, you wouldn't be able to see the &lt;html&gt;'s blue background on the webpage's left or right!</p>

			<p>Because if you take a look at both the HTML and the CSS, you should notice that four elements in total have a unique background color.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The &lt;html&gt; element has a blue background-color as written in the HTML file</li>
				<li>The &lt;body&gt; element has a yellow background-color as written in the HTML file</li>
				<li>The only element with the class "example" has a black background-color as written in the CSS file</li>
				<li>The only element with the class "example-2" has an half-transparent red background-color as written in the CSS file, making it orange as it is positionned on yellow</li>
			</ul>

			<p>One of the many interesting things of this webpage is that the "Hello World!" text goes partially outside of the "example" &lt;div&gt; represented in black.<br>"Hello World!" also doesn't start at the left side of the &lt;div&gt; element. So why is all of that happening?</p>

			<p>Well, all of that is due to the combination of three particular attributes that the "example" class has.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>It has a "width" of 10%, which means that its horizontal size will be equal to 10% of the width of the web browser's window</li>
				<li>It has a "font-size" of 100px, which means that all content that is text inside this element will have a size of 100 pixels</li>
				<li>It has a "padding-left" of 2em, its value translates to the font-size times 2 (so 200px), "padding-left" applies padding only to the left-side of the element</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So the width makes the element small, the padding makes it so everything inside it is away from its left side and the font-size makes it so the text's big.<br>In the end, the "Hello World!" is too big to be fully contained by its parent element, the &lt;div&gt; with the "example" class.<br>The same goes for the image featuring emperor penguins.</p>

			<p>The "example-2" class has a difference with the "example" class. The images have a "height" and a "width" attributes!<br>If you change the size of your window, the images will adapt themselves, try it!</p>

			<p>The "example-2" class's size is defined by a few things.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The &lt;body&gt; has a "padding-right" of 100px, making its very right side unreachable for "example-2"</li>
				<li>The class itself has a "margin-left" of 2em (so 50px as "font-size" is 25px), which makes yellow visible between the blue and the orange</li>
				<li>The size of the images featuring seals that are within the class itself also define its size. Let me explain!</li>
			</ol>

			<p>So, the size of those images in particular are dependant of the size of your web browser's window, that, we already know.<br>However, most elements such as &lt;divs&gt; have a size that is adapted to conveniently fit all elements that are inside itsell, which, by the way, is how the actual CyberPop! website works no matter the size of your web browser's window.<br>The &lt;div&gt; with the "example" class was different as we had put a "width" attribute to it, which prevented it from adapting itself according to its children elements' size.</p>

			<p>The position of those images is basically decided by their padding, which is vertically 0px and horizontally 70px.<br>So they're far away from each other horizontally, and really close to each other vertically.</p>

			<p>The "Bye World!" text has nothing special, it is where it is, on the top-left, because it has no attribute that would change its position, only a font and a font-size.<br>However, what's up with those skeletons?..</p>

			<p>Well, they have a "height" and "width" of 60%. But they clearly do not take 60% of the screen.<br>It's because they use the "float" attribute which is weird. You'll get to know it one day!<br>But just know that as it is, without float, on a big computer screen, it would take 60% of screen width and a lot more of screen height due to its proportions.<br>Not all images can fit entirely and perfectly on your screen, for example this image is larger vertically than horizontally!</p>
