			<h1>Being dependant on web searching rather than knowledge</h1>

			<p>As you may have noticed, there is a lot of elements in HTML, a lot of attributes and values in CSS, and a lot of functions in JS. You may think that you are expected to know everything about all three of thoses languages in order to create a somewhat good-looking webpage, but that, thankfully, isn't true.</p>

			<p>What you are expected to know is those three languages' syntax, their concepts, as well as their role in a webpage, and that is what CyberPop taught you!<br>But even if you know the syntax and the concepts of those languages, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be able to apply them.</p>

			<p>You will come up with ideas that would be using the concepts you have learned, but how to apply ideas is somewhat hard and differs depending on the language.<br>(It isn't so bad in web development if you only use Javascript as a programming language, though!)</p>

			<p>For example, let's say that in HTML, you've made some &lt;p&gt; elements, all with different classes. How to make a function in JS that gets all &lt;p&gt; elements with a certain class in order to make those slightly bigger is something you probably currently have no idea how to do in practice, though you may have some sort of theory.</p>

			<p>Like, there's probably a function in JS that gets all elements fitting that description, and you can do a for loop to go through an array of those elements, but do you even remember how to make a for loop, and do you even know what function in JS gets all elements from a webpage that have a certain class?</p>

			<p>There's definitely no shame in not knowing, truly. As I said, you're not expected, and you will never be expected to know every JS function!<br>So.. how do you apply your idea if you don't know how?..</p>

			<p>One of the skills you will need to get while trying to make a webpage (or a software) is web searching, using web search engines such as <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a>, really, any engine you think gets you the results you want, and you may use as many of them as you want, it's really up to your choice!</p>

			<p>What sentences to use for web searching is also something up to preference, but what I recommend is putting the name of the language first, then the concept, and finally what you want to do with as little words as possible. An example would be "JS array remove last element".</p>

			<p>And finally, which results you should visit. Any <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> link should be your top priority (imo), followed by documentation, which, for web development, will usually always be on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla's website</a>, otherwise usually on websites provided by the people who are behind the thing you have issues with.<br>For example, if you're using C#, you may want to take a look at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank">Microsoft's website!</a></p>

			<p>This lesson really applies to any language, even for software development. Constantly doing web searches is key to making something you will be proud of!</p>
