# CyberPop!

CyberPop! is a static website built to teach the basics of technology to people who don't know anything about it, from kids to the elderly!

It aims to make the concepts of technology more comprehensible to everyone before they decide to put their time (and money) into learning it, for example through a course.

**Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute to this project!!**

### How do I check out how it looks?

CyberPop is currently in development, and therefore isn't currently available anywhere on the Internet, with the exception of [GitHub Pages](https://tttaevas.github.io/CyberPop/) which updates itself everytime commits are pushed to [CyberPop's repository](https://github.com/TTTaevas/CyberPop).
